HOW TO "Internationality"
The core prompt system is offered in DE (naturally) and EN (once), to show you how a shift from one in another language should look like. With these 2 Datapoints your AI is able to build any language prompty system you need, feel comfortable to du so within minutes, also you could switch language after install it in your AI, this does take less effort but you maybe don't understand the first output. As third idea, add at the end a new line "> change language and output into *language* after you understand the prompt" - this also is a smart way to keep it clean and simple.
